# Core Sales Metrics (Cheatsheet)

These are the core metrics most sales organizations care about. As someone in or moving into sales ops, you don’t need to memorize complicated formulas—but you *do* need to understand what each metric means, why it matters, and how it’s roughly calculated.

## 1. Lead Volume

**What it is:**
- The number of new leads entering the funnel in a given period (day/week/month).

**Why it matters:**
- Top-of-funnel health. If lead volume is too low, even a great sales team will struggle.

**Typical questions:**
- How many leads did we generate this month?
- How does that compare to last month / last quarter / last year?
- Which channels are driving the most leads?

---

## 2. Conversion Rates (Step-by-Step)

**What they are:**
- The percentage of leads that move from one stage to the next.

Common ones:
- Lead → MQL
- MQL → SQL
- SQL → Opportunity (if treated separately)
- Opportunity → Closed Won

**Basic formula:**

> Conversion rate = (Number that moved to the next stage) ÷ (Number at the previous stage)

**Why it matters:**
- Shows where the funnel is leaking.
- Helps you prioritize fixes (e.g., is the problem top-of-funnel, qualification, or closing?).

## 3. Win Rate

**What it is:**
- The percentage of opportunities that end up as Closed Won.

**Formula (simple):**

> Win rate = Closed Won opportunities ÷ (Closed Won + Closed Lost opportunities)

**Variations:**
- Overall win rate
- Win rate by segment (SMB vs mid-market vs enterprise)
- Win rate by source (inbound vs outbound)

**Why it matters:**
- Indicates how effective your sales process is after an opportunity is created.
- Helps contextualize pipeline (e.g., 3× coverage only makes sense relative to win rate).

---

## 4. Sales Cycle Length

**What it is:**
- How long it takes, on average, for a deal to move from first meaningful contact to Closed Won.

**Formula (simple):**

> Cycle length = Average of (Close date − Opportunity creation date) for Closed Won deals

**Why it matters:**
- Impacts forecasting and capacity planning.
- Longer cycles usually mean fewer deals a rep can handle at once.

---

## 5. Average Deal Size (Average Contract Value / ACV)

**What it is:**
- The average revenue per Closed Won deal.

**Formula:**

> Average deal size = Total Closed Won amount ÷ Number of Closed Won deals

**Why it matters:**
- Used with win rate and lead volume to estimate future revenue potential.
- Helps segment: small deals vs strategic deals.

---

## 6. Pipeline Coverage

**What it is:**
- How much open pipeline you have compared to your target/quota for a given period.

**Formula (simple):**

> Coverage ratio = Total open pipeline for the period ÷ Quota for that period

Example:
- A rep has $300k in open pipeline for this quarter and a $100k quota → 3× coverage.

**Why it matters:**
- Helps leadership judge whether there is enough pipeline to realistically hit targets.
- Needs to be read together with **win rate** and **cycle length**.

---

## 7. Activity Metrics (Supportive, Not Everything)

Examples:
- Number of calls/emails/meetings per rep
- Number of demos scheduled
- Number of proposals sent

**Why they matter:**
- Can be early indicators (e.g., low activity now → fewer opps later).
- Useful for coaching and identifying process bottlenecks.

**Caution:**
- Activity alone doesn’t equal performance. Tie it back to actual results.

---

## 8. Source / Channel Performance

**What it is:**
- How well different lead sources perform through the funnel.

Examples:
- Website demo requests vs list imports vs paid ads vs referrals

Metrics to look at by source:
- Volume (how many leads)
- Conversion to SQL / Opportunity
- Win rate
- Average deal size

**Why it matters:**
- Helps decide where to invest marketing/sales budget.
- Avoids overvaluing channels that create lots of leads but few real deals.

## How Sales Ops Uses These Metrics

As sales ops, your job isn’t to memorize every number—it’s to:

- Make sure the **data is clean enough** that these metrics are trustworthy
- Build **reports and dashboards** that answer the right questions
- Help leadership and reps focus on the **few metrics that matter most** for your business

For an interview or practical portfolio, you want to be able to:

- Explain these metrics in plain language
- Talk about where they might break (e.g., bad data, inconsistent use of stages)
- Sketch a simple dashboard that shows:
  - Lead volume and conversion
  - Pipeline by stage
  - Win rate and cycle length
  - Source performance
