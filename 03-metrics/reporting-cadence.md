# Reporting Cadence (Who Sees What, and When)

A good reporting cadence answers:

- **Who** needs to see which numbers
- **How often** they need to see them
- **What decisions** those numbers are supposed to support

This doc outlines a simple, realistic cadence for a small/medium B2B sales org. You can adapt it up or down depending on team size.

## Weekly: Frontline & Manager View

### Audience

- Individual reps
- First-line managers

### Purpose

- Keep deals moving
- Catch issues early (slipping deals, stuck stages, missing next steps)

### Core reports / views

1. **My Open Opportunities** (for reps)
   - Filter: Owner = current user, Stage not Closed
   - Columns: Stage, Amount, Close Date, Next Step, Last Activity Date
   - Sort: by Close Date, then Stage

2. **Manager Pipeline Review**
   - Filter: Team’s open opportunities, Stage not Closed
   - Columns: Rep, Stage, Amount, Close Date, Next Step, Age in Stage
   - Used in weekly 1:1s and team pipeline reviews

3. **Activity Summary (Optional)**
   - Calls, emails, meetings per rep
   - Not for micromanaging—but for spotting clear outliers and coaching opportunities

## Monthly: Leadership & Cross-Functional View

### Audience

- Head of Sales / VP Sales
- Marketing leadership
- RevOps / Finance (if present)

### Purpose

- Understand how the funnel performed
- Align sales and marketing
- Identify bigger trends, not just week-to-week noise

### Core reports

1. **Funnel Conversion Report**
   - Lead → MQL → SQL → Opportunity → Closed Won
   - By source, segment, or campaign

2. **Revenue & Pipeline Report**
   - Closed Won amount vs target for the month
   - Open pipeline for next 1–2 months (by stage)

3. **Source / Channel Performance**
   - Leads, SQLs, Opps, Wins, and Revenue by source
   - Helps decide where to invest more/less

4. **Closed Lost Reasons**
   - Breakdown of why deals are lost
   - Useful input for product, pricing, and marketing messaging

## Quarterly: Strategic View

### Audience

- Executive team
- Sales leadership
- Sometimes board-level reporting

### Purpose

- Zoom out from month-to-month variance
- Check whether strategy is working
- Inform larger decisions (headcount, territories, product focus)

### Core reports

1. **Quarterly Performance vs Target**
   - Revenue vs quota by team, territory, and/or segment

2. **Trend Lines**
   - 3–4 quarter view of:
     - Lead volume
     - Conversion rates
     - Win rates
     - Average deal size
     - Cycle length

3. **Segment Performance**
   - SMB vs mid-market vs enterprise
   - New business vs expansion/upsell (if applicable)

4. **Forecast Accuracy (If tracked)**
   - How actuals compared vs earlier forecasts
   - Helps calibrate future forecasting methods

## Daily (Lightweight): Rep Inboxes & Alerts

### Audience

- Reps

### Purpose

- Nudge behavior
- Prevent small issues from becoming big problems

### Examples

- Automated daily email/Slack summary:
  - New leads assigned
  - Overdue tasks
  - Opportunities with close dates in the past

As sales ops, you want to **minimize noise** here—only send what’s truly useful.

## How to Talk About This in an Interview

When someone asks how you think about reporting, you can:

- Start with the cadence: weekly for execution, monthly for trends, quarterly for strategy.
- Give 1–2 concrete examples of reports at each level.
- Emphasize that reports should:
  - Answer specific questions
  - Be used in actual meetings (not just exist in the CRM)
  - Drive decisions (coaching, territory focus, campaign changes, etc.)

You don’t need to be a BI engineer to be valuable here. Being the person who can:

- Translate what leadership and reps care about into clear reports
- Keep data clean enough that those reports are trustworthy
- Suggest a sensible cadence for looking at them

…is already a strong sales ops contribution.
