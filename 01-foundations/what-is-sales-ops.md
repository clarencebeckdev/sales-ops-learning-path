# What Is Sales Operations?

Sales operations is the function that keeps a sales organization **organized, measurable, and scalable**.

If frontline sales is about talking to customers and closing deals, sales operations is about:

- Designing the **process** those deals move through
- Owning the **systems and data** that support that process
- Building and maintaining the **reports and dashboards** that show what’s working
- Helping reps and managers spend more time selling and less time fighting the tools

For a SaaS / software company, sales ops usually sits at the intersection of:

- **Sales leadership** – to define targets, stages, and rules
- **Marketing** – to make sure leads are captured, routed, and measured correctly
- **Customer success / onboarding** – to ensure smooth handoffs after the sale
- **RevOps / Finance / BI** (if they exist) – to align on metrics and forecasting

## What Sales Ops Typically Owns

Different companies slice it differently, but these are common ownership areas:

### 1. CRM structure and data hygiene

- Defining pipeline **stages** and required fields
- Making sure Leads / Contacts / Accounts / Opportunities are used consistently
- Managing validation rules, picklists, and layouts
- Creating the views and reports reps and managers actually use

### 2. Process design and documentation

- Defining how leads move from **Marketing → SDR → AE**
- Defining what it means for a lead to become an **SQL** and when an **Opportunity** is created
- Documenting handoffs to onboarding / customer success
- Creating checklists for pipeline hygiene and stage movement

### 3. Reporting, metrics, and forecasting support

- Building and maintaining reports:
  - Conversion rates (Lead → MQL → SQL → Opp → Won)
  - Win rates, cycle length, average deal size
  - Source performance (e.g. which channels drive real revenue)
- Helping leadership understand pipeline coverage and forecast quality

### 4. Tooling and enablement

- Owning the sales tech stack (CRM, dialer, enrichment, scheduling, etc.)
- Working with reps to make workflows less painful (fewer clicks, clearer fields)
- Rolling out new tools and documenting how to use them

## How This Is Different From Frontline Sales

Coming from sales, you’ve already seen a lot of this from the **user** side:

- You’ve lived inside a CRM (logging calls, updating stages, chasing tasks)
- You know what bad data or messy processes feel like
- You’ve seen which reports managers care about in pipeline review

Sales operations shifts the perspective:

- From “How do **I** hit my number?”
- To “How do we make it easier for **everyone** to hit their number, and prove what’s happening with data?”

That means:

- Caring about **consistency** across reps and teams
- Saying "no" sometimes to keep the system clean
- Thinking in terms of **systems and feedback loops**, not just individual deals

## What This Learning Path Will Emphasize

Given a background in selling lead generation services and software/digital marketing, this repo will focus on:

- B2B-ish, subscription-style sales motions (even if ACVs are on the lower side)
- Lead → opportunity flows where lead volume is high and quality varies
- Practical, CRM-agnostic concepts you can apply in Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.

You don’t need to be a hardcore admin or analyst on day one. The goal is to:

1. Understand the **concepts and responsibilities** well enough to speak confidently in interviews.
2. Show your thinking in a structured way through these docs and a few simple examples (dashboards, checklists, routing logic).
