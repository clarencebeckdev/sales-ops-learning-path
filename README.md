# Sales Ops Learning Path

This repo is a combined **learning notebook** and **portfolio** for transitioning from frontline sales to sales operations.

It’s written from the perspective of someone with experience in selling lead generation services and software/digital marketing, who is now building out the operations side: process, data, tooling, and reporting.

## Structure

- `01-foundations/` – What sales operations is, how it fits with sales / marketing / CS
- `02-process/` – Pipeline stages, lead lifecycle, handoffs, qualification frameworks
- `03-metrics/` – Core metrics, pipeline health, forecasting basics, reporting cadence
- `04-tools/` – CRM concepts, data cleaning, lead routing rules, light automation ideas
- `05-communication/` – How to communicate changes, write guides, and support reps

Each section is intentionally short and practical. The goal is to be able to hand this repo to a hiring manager and let them see how you think about sales ops.

> Work in progress — this is meant to evolve as I learn more and add concrete examples (dashboards, sample reports, routing logic, etc.).
