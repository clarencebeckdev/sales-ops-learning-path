# Sales Ops Principles (Working Draft)

These are personal operating principles you can use to describe how you approach sales operations. They’re written in a way that you can honestly stand behind, even as you’re still learning the role.

## 1. Data should reflect reality, not aspirations

If the CRM and reports don’t match what’s actually happening, everything built on top of them is shaky.

- I’d rather have honest, messy numbers than inflated ones that look good but mislead.
- Stage definitions and close dates should describe reality, not hope.

## 2. Make the right thing the easy thing

Reps are busy and focused on selling. If a process or tool makes their life harder, it won’t stick.

- I try to reduce clicks, simplify fields, and design views that match how reps actually work.
- Good sales ops removes friction instead of adding more hoops.

## 3. Start small, iterate fast

Big process overhauls tend to fail. Small, well-scoped changes are easier to ship and improve.

- I prefer piloting changes with a subset of reps, gathering feedback, then rolling out.
- I’m comfortable revising a process when we learn something new.

## 4. Be a bridge between teams

Sales ops sits between sales, marketing, CS, and sometimes finance.

- I try to translate between perspectives instead of taking sides.
- When there’s a disagreement, I look for the underlying data and shared goals.

## 5. Write things down

Processes that only exist in someone’s head break as soon as that person is busy or leaves.

- I favor short, clear docs and checklists over long, complicated manuals.
- If something matters, it should be documented in a place people actually use.

## 6. Measure what matters (and ignore the rest)

There are infinite things we *could* measure, but only a few actually influence decisions.

- I focus on a small set of core metrics that tie to revenue and pipeline health.
- I’m wary of over-optimizing activity metrics without context.

## 7. Respect the rep’s perspective

Reps feel the impact of process and CRM decisions every day.

- I listen carefully to rep feedback, especially around what feels confusing or slow.
- I look for solutions that align rep incentives with data quality and process adherence.

These principles are meant to evolve. As I gain more experience in sales operations, I expect to refine and add to them.
