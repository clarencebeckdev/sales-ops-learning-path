**Subject:** Update to Opportunity Stages – Making Pipeline Reviews Easier

**Hi team,**

We’re making a small update to our opportunity stages to make pipeline reviews easier and our reporting more accurate.

**What’s changing**

- We’re renaming the **"In Discussion"** stage to **"Qualified / Discovery"**.
- We’re adding clearer entry/exit criteria for each stage.
- We’re making **Amount** and **Close Date** required before you can move a deal into **"Proposal / Evaluation"**.

**Why we’re doing this**

- To make it clearer when a deal is truly qualified vs just an early conversation.
- To improve forecast accuracy (so we’re not surprised at the end of the month).
- To reduce back-and-forth in pipeline reviews by having consistent definitions.

**What you need to do**

- Starting **next Monday**, please:
  - Use **"Qualified / Discovery"** only when you’ve had a real discovery conversation.
  - Make sure **Amount** and **Close Date** are filled in before moving a deal into **"Proposal / Evaluation"**.
  - Use the updated view **"My Open Opps – New Stages"** for your daily work.

**Support / questions**

- I’ve added a short doc with stage definitions here: `[link to pipeline-stages.md or internal doc]`.
- If you’re unsure which stage to use, ping me or your manager and we’ll sort it out.

Thanks for helping keep the pipeline clean and the data trustworthy.

**– Clarence**
