# Pipeline Stages (for a Typical B2B/SaaS Sales Process)

This is a generic pipeline that would work for many B2B/SaaS-ish teams. The point isn’t that *every* company has to use these exact names, but that stages are:

- **Clear** – reps know when a deal belongs in each stage
- **Mutually exclusive** – a deal should only ever fit one stage at a time
- **Progressive** – moving a stage forward means something real happened

Below is a reference pipeline and what each stage means.

---

## 1. New / Incoming

**What it is:**
- A new lead or opportunity that has just arrived (form fill, inbound call, list import, outbound prospecting, etc.).

**Entry criteria (examples):**
- Lead is created in the CRM from a defined source (web form, call tracking, import, etc.).
- Basic contact info is present (name, phone/email, company if B2B).

**Exit criteria:**
- Rep attempts contact and either:
  - Moves to **Trying to Contact / Working**, or
  - Marks as disqualified/duplicate.

**Owner:**
- SDR/BDR or AE (depending on the model).

---

## 2. Working / Contacting

**What it is:**
- The rep is actively trying to connect with the lead and understand if there’s a real opportunity.

**Entry criteria:**
- At least one outreach step has been taken (call, email, SMS, LinkedIn, etc.).

**Exit criteria:**
- You’ve successfully connected and qualified the opportunity → move to **Qualified / Discovery**.
- Or: you’ve exhausted the outreach sequence and there’s no response → mark as **Closed Lost – Unresponsive** or move to a “Nurture” state if marketing continues to work them.

**Owner:**
- SDR/BDR or AE.

## 3. Qualified / Discovery

**What it is:**
- You’ve had a conversation and there is a real business need and a plausible fit.
- You are actively in discovery: understanding their situation, constraints, and what a good outcome looks like.

**Entry criteria (examples):**
- Basic qualification met (whichever framework is used—BANT, MEDDIC, etc.).
- They agree there is a problem worth solving and are interested in your solution.

**Exit criteria:**
- A concrete next step is scheduled (demo, deeper discovery, proposal review, etc.).
- You have enough information to either:
  - Move to **Proposal / Evaluation**, or
  - Mark as **Closed Lost – No Fit / Not Ready**.

**Owner:**
- Usually AE (sometimes SDR in orgs where SDRs run discovery).

---

## 4. Proposal / Evaluation

**What it is:**
- The prospect is actively evaluating your solution.
- You’ve shared pricing and/or a proposal, or you’re in the process of tailoring one.

**Entry criteria:**
- Discovery call(s) completed.
- Prospect confirms they want a proposal, trial, pilot, or formal evaluation.

**Activities in this stage:**
- Demos, technical reviews, pricing discussions, legal/security review, etc.

**Exit criteria:**
- Prospect indicates strong intent to move forward, and you’re working through final approvals → move to **Commit / Verbal**.
- Or: they decide against moving forward → **Closed Lost**.

**Owner:**
- AE.

---

## 5. Commit / Verbal

**What it is:**
- The prospect has given a verbal "yes" or strong buying signals and you’re clearing final steps (paperwork, signatures, PO, internal approvals).

**Entry criteria:**
- Clear confirmation from the prospect that they intend to buy, assuming final terms are acceptable.

**Exit criteria:**
- Contract is signed / agreement accepted → **Closed Won**.
- Or: deal falls apart due to terms, budget, internal politics, etc. → **Closed Lost**.

**Owner:**
- AE.

---

## 6. Closed Won

**What it is:**
- Customer has signed or otherwise committed per your company’s definition of a closed sale.

**Entry criteria:**
- Contract signed / agreement accepted / payment received (depending on the model).

**What happens next:**
- Handoff to onboarding / implementation / customer success.
- Ensure that subscription details, start dates, and handoff notes are complete.

**Owner:**
- AE (for the opportunity), then CS/onboarding for customer lifecycle.

---

## 7. Closed Lost

**What it is:**
- The opportunity is no longer being pursued.

**Entry criteria:**
- Prospect explicitly says no, chooses a competitor, goes dark after reasonable attempts, or becomes ineligible.

**Key best practices:**
- Always capture a **Closed Lost reason** (e.g., price, timing, no decision, chosen competitor, etc.).
- If appropriate, tag deals that may come back later (e.g., "Revisit in 6 months").

## Why Stage Definitions Matter

Clear stage definitions:

- Make **reporting meaningful** (e.g., win rate by stage, cycle time per stage)
- Help reps know what’s expected to move a deal forward
- Prevent sandbagging or premature stage movement
- Make forecasting more honest (e.g., if only deals in Commit/Verbal should be considered "real" commits)

In a sales ops role, you’re often the person who:

- Writes and maintains these definitions
- Aligns with sales leadership on changes
- Enforces them via CRM configuration (required fields, validation rules, etc.)
