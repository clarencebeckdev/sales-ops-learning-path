# Qualification Frameworks: BANT & MEDDIC (Practical Cheatsheet)

Qualification frameworks are just structured ways to answer a simple question:

> Is this opportunity **real**, and is it worth more of our time?

You don’t need to interrogate someone with an acronym checklist on a call, but you *do* want to walk away with these concepts covered.

Below are two common frameworks and how to use them in a practical way.

---

## BANT

**Stands for:** Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline

### What it’s good for

- Simple, easy to remember.
- Works well in higher-volume, shorter-cycle sales.
- Good for quickly separating curious shoppers from real buyers.

### The four pieces

1. **Budget**
   - Do they have money set aside, or a realistic way to get it?
   - Are they thinking in the same price range as you?
   - If not, are they willing to adjust other spend to make room?

   *Questions you might ask:*
   - "Have you invested in something like this before?"
   - "Do you already have budget assigned for this project, or would that need approval?"

2. **Authority**
   - Are you talking to someone who can approve the purchase or strongly influence it?
   - Who else is involved, and what does the approval chain look like?

   *Questions:*
   - "Besides you, who else would need to be involved in making this decision?"
   - "Who signs off on this kind of spend in your org?"

3. **Need**
   - Do they actually have a problem your product solves?
   - Is the pain strong enough that they’re motivated to change?

   *Questions:*
   - "What prompted you to look into this now?"
   - "What happens if nothing changes over the next 6–12 months?"

4. **Timeline**
   - When are they hoping to decide and go live?
   - Are there real deadlines (events, contracts ending, seasonality)?

   *Questions:*
   - "What does your ideal timeline look like for deciding and getting this in place?"
   - "Are there any upcoming dates we should be aware of—renewals, busy seasons, etc.?"

### How sales ops can use BANT

- Create simple fields in the CRM (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline notes).
- Encourage reps to capture short, specific notes instead of long essays.
- Use reports to see how often opportunities are created **without** basic BANT info.

## MEDDIC (and MEDDICC)

**Stands for:**
- **M**etrics
- **E**conomic Buyer
- **D**ecision Criteria
- **D**ecision Process
- **I**dentify Pain
- **C**hampion

(Some versions add another **C** for Competition.)

### What it’s good for

- More detailed, better for complex B2B deals with multiple stakeholders.
- Helps avoid surprises late in the cycle ("We didn’t know legal had to sign off" etc.).

### The pieces

1. **Metrics**
   - What measurable outcome are they after?
   - How will they decide if this was successful?

   *Questions:*
   - "If this goes well, how will you know?"
   - "Are there specific numbers you want to move—revenue, time saved, close rate, etc.?"

2. **Economic Buyer**
   - Who ultimately controls the budget and signs off?

   *Questions:*
   - "Who owns the budget for this?"
   - "Have they seen solutions like this before?"

3. **Decision Criteria**
   - How will they compare you to alternatives?
   - What must be true for them to say yes?

   *Questions:*
   - "When you’ve bought tools like this before, what mattered most?"
   - "If you had to pick three things that matter most here, what would they be?"

4. **Decision Process**
   - The actual steps from now to a signed contract.

   *Questions:*
   - "What are the steps from here to a final decision?"
   - "Who needs to review this—IT, legal, finance?"

5. **Identify Pain**
   - The specific problems they’re trying to solve.

   *Questions:*
   - "What’s the hardest part of this today?"
   - "What does this problem cost you in time or money right now?"

6. **Champion**
   - A person inside the org who wants you to win and can influence others.

   *Questions:*
   - "Who else inside your team is excited about solving this?"
   - "Who tends to drive projects like this forward internally?"

7. **Competition** (optional extra C)
   - Who else are they looking at—other vendors, internal build, "do nothing"?

   *Questions:*
   - "What other options are you considering alongside us?"
   - "Have you tried solving this another way before?"

### How sales ops can use MEDDIC

- Create structured fields or notes areas for key elements (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Champion, etc.).
- Use opportunity views or reports that surface whether these fields are filled in for late-stage deals.
- Partner with sales leadership to define **minimum required information** before a deal can move into later stages (e.g., Commit/Verbal).

## How to Think About These Frameworks (Practically)

- Don’t treat BANT or MEDDIC as scripts to read at a prospect.
- Think of them as **checklists in your head**:
  - "Do I understand their problem and what good looks like?"
  - "Do I know who really decides and how?"
  - "Is this likely to close in a realistic timeframe?"

As you move into sales ops, you’re not the one asking these questions on calls—but you *are* the one helping:

- Define which parts must be captured in the CRM.
- Build reports that show where deals are weak (e.g., no identified economic buyer but in a late stage).
- Align with managers on when a deal is considered truly qualified.
